/* Exercise 1:
Write a query that outputs all records from the Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader table. 
Include the following columns from the table:
PurchaseOrderID
VendorID
OrderDate
TotalDue
Add a derived column called NonRejectedItems which returns, for each purchase order ID in the query output,
the number of line items from the Purchasing.PurchaseOrderDetail table which did not have
any rejections (i.e., RejectedQty = 0). Use a correlated subquery to do this.

Modify your query to include a second derived field called MostExpensiveItem.
This field should return, for each purchase order ID, the UnitPrice of the most expensive item for that order in the 
Purchasing.PurchaseOrderDetail table.
Use a correlated subquery to do this as well.
