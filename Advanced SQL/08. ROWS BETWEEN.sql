/* Exercise 1:
Create a query with the following columns:
“OrderMonth”, a derived column (you’ll have to create this one yourself) featuring the month number corresponding 
with the Order Date in a given row
“OrderYear”, a derived column featuring the year corresponding with the Order Date in a given row
“SubTotal” from the Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader table
Your query should be an aggregate query – specifically, it should sum “SubTotal”, and group by the remaining fields.

Modify your query from Exercise 1 by adding a derived column called "Rolling3MonthTotal",

HINT: You will need to include multiple fields in your ORDER BY to get this to work!
