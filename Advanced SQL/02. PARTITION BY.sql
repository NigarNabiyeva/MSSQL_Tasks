/*Exercise 1:
Create a query with the following columns:
“Name” from the Production.Product table, which can be alised as “ProductName”
“ListPrice” from the Production.Product table
“Name” from the Production. ProductSubcategory table, which can be alised as “ProductSubcategory”*
“Name” from the Production.ProductCategory table, which can be alised as “ProductCategory”**
*Join Production.ProductSubcategory to Production.Product on “ProductSubcategoryID”
**Join Production.ProductCategory to ProductSubcategory on “ProductCategoryID”
All the tables can be inner joined, and you do not need to apply any criteria.
