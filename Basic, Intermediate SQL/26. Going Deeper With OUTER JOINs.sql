1. Create a query with the following columns:
 - SalesOrderID, OrderDate, and TotalDue from the "Sales.SalesOrderHeader" table
 - A derived column called "Percent of Sales YTD", calculated as follows:
The value in the "TotalDue" column from Sales.SalesOrderHeader, 
divided by the value in the "SalesYTD" field from the Sales.SalesPerson table, then multiplied by 100.
**You can connect the two tables by the "SalesPersonID" and "BusinessEntityID" fields, respectively.
Return all rows from Sales.SalesOrderHeader that have a total due amount greater than $2,000, 
regardless of whether there is a sales person associated with the sale.
Sort the output by sales order ID, ascending.
