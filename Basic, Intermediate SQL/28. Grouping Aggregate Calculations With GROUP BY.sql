You just have to make sure that you include the same derived field in both your SELECT and GROUP BY.
With that in mind, "prettify" your output from Exercise 2 by displaying "No color" in the "Color" column 
in place of NULL values, and "NA" in the "Style" column in place of NULL values.
HINT: The ISNULL function could be handy here.
